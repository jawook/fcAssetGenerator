This repo is code used for generating promotional materials for the Alberta Forever Canada Citizen's Initiative.  It looks to centralize commonly needed visual assets and automate the production of custom assets in a simple, consistent way.

No infringment or overstep intended.  Just trying to make it easier for canvassers to do what they need to do (which is collecting signatures).
